The Multnomah County Bike Fair (aka *Bike Fair*) is an **almost** annual event held as part of [Pedalpalooza](/pages/pedalpalooza/) since 2007 in beautiful Portland, Oregon. 

It's a family-friendly bike event open to the public, featuring games (slow races, bike jousting), entertainment (live music, casual competitions), arts + crafts, and general silly fun. 

Wanna help make this event awesome? 2022 participants + volunteers sought - reach out to [Shelly](https://www.instagram.com/oh_shell/) if you're interested in joining us. The main stage is all about participation, fun, and antics. Show off your bike dance troupe or run a competition. Tell us your dreams! We also need help setting up, breaking down, hosting booths, and helping keep the park clean.
